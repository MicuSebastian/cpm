The idea behind the project was to create a mobile application that would improve the visibility of cultural heritage using photogrammetry. Using the Flutter framework, I was able to develop a mobile app for Android and iOS users, which will be a first step towards achieving the goal. The 3DF Zephyr software was also used, which has several procedures to select the optimal parameters to create a detailed 3D model.
